# PackageDeliverySimulation
A package delivery simulation that uses a nearest neighbor algorithm to deliver packages with a map of addresses and distances.

<h2>Description</h2>
This project uses Python code to run a simulation of two delivery drivers delivering packages that have specific requirements to varrying addresses across a city.
The goal of the simulation was to determine a route for the delivery drivers to deliver packages while fulfilling package requirements and optimal time management. 
This project was created to analyze time and space complexities of greedy vs heuristic algorithms, and to evaluate appropriate data structures to create a system to 
hold package data, and create a map to represent the city.
