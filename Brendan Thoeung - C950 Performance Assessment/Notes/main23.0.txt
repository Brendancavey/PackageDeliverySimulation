Cleaned up some code. 

Removed some redundant code in the delivery algorithm such as updating time, finding shortest path, and loading
packages into unvisited verticies queue. I put each function into their own separete function and called them when
needed in to delivery algorithm function. Left the comments of the previous version just in case.

Tried putting big functions into their own module. Too much of a headache to deal with, reverted back. 

Issues still present from v21.0. Will deal with tomorrow.
