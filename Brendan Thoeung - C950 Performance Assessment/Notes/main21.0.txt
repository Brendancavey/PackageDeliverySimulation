Started to create interface. While testing, found more bugs, and im crying. Packages that were delivered from
truck 3 are showing as delivered when they should be at hub. Same with some packages from truck2. All packages showing delivered
at times when they should be something else:

6, 9, 25, 28, 32, 33, 35, 39

6 - condition attached delivered by truck 2 at 10:13am

9 - condition attache ddelivered by truck 3 at 10:39am

25- conditions attached delivered by truck 2 at 9:41am

28 - conditions attached delivered by truck 2 at 9:58am

32 - no conditions delivered by truck 2 at 10:08am

33 - no conditions delivered by truck 3 at 10:03am

35 - no conditions delivered by truck 3 at 10:24am

39 - no conditions delivered by truck 3 at 10:29am

packages 6, 25, 28, 32, should be considered at hub until picked up by truck2 sometime after 9:05 am when the packages "arrive"

packages 9, 33, 35, 39 should be considered at hub until truck 3 takes off at 9:54am, where then they'll be considered on route
until delivered.



Other than that, started to create interface.
