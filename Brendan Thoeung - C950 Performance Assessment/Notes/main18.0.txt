All conditions fulfilled. All packages delivered on time. Verified and checked.

But now, some packages are saying they haven't been delivered in the delivery status dictionary. I checked previous times,
and some of the packages say they were "on route" as expected, and "devliered" as expected at the time of delivery, but times
afterwards claim they are "at the hub"
