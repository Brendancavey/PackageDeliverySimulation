Added to the package and vertex an id to verify that the package delivery address matches the vertex address. This is used
to confirm when removing packages from the truck at time of delivery. 

Found issue with python for-loop when removing packages from truck during iteration, python changes the index of
the current iteration to reflect the removal. So packages even with a matching id to the vertex may be skipped during the 
first iteration. For now, I have to run through the loop again in a nested for-loop to account for any packages
missed for removal due to the index change.

Successfully incorporated condition for the project where after 10:20am, the delivery driver gets the correct address
for package 9.

Attempted to incorporate another condition for the project where packages 6, 25, 28, and 32 arrive late to the hub at 9:05am. 
Truck2 gets the update anytime after 9:05 am and reroute to the hub to load these late packages. 
Successfully confirmed these new packages have been added to the truck, and the correct vertex address have been 
added to the queue of unvisited verticies, but once the truck reaches the end of the original queue, the truck just goes home
without the new packages being delivered. 

Also tracking the delivery times of each package, the new packages that arrived late are not going to arrive on time
as at their designated delivery due time.
