Found out when trying to incorporate a nested dictionary and updating the value of the nested dictionary, all subsequent values
are updated as well - so that doesn't work. I instead managed to incorporate a nested list within a dictionary. So a list of lists
as the value of a dictionary key. The nested list holds the package and delivery status of that package. The dictionary uses
the time as the key. So far, this works with 1 truck. I have yet to try with all 3 trucks...

Also did some cleanup of code. Simplified some long expressions into simple to read variables. Updated hashtable search function
to return the value of the key and not just the index of the item.

Updated Truck and Driver to have designated departure and return times.
