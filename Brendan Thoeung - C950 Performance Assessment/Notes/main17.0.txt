Found out the issue causing packages to not be delivered. When going through the for-loop, it doesn't account for new packages coming in, so the for loop doesn't adjust to the new length of the list. To fix this, I changed the for-loop to a while loop,
and used while the list length is greater than 0, continue. By doing so, all packages were able to be delivered,
including new ones that arrived late, and added during delivery route.

Program is functioning as intended. Need to continue fulfilling a few more conditions for project all the while making sure
packages are still being delivered on time with these changes. Currently, all packages are being delivered on time, with the last
package with a delivery deadline hardly making the deadline cutoff by 3 minutes.
