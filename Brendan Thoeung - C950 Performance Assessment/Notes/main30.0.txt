Fixed a majority of the issue. Updated package status dictionary from packages delivered from truck2 when truck3
iterates. So now majority of packages are showing correct information. Found packagse showing on route or delivered
when they should be delivered. 

Packages 35 showing on route by 8:30 but doesn't leave hub until 9:54

Package 33 Showing delivered by 8:30 but doesnt leave hub until 9:54 

package 9 showing delivered by 8:30 but doesnt leave hub until 9:54

package 39 showing delivered by 8:30 but doesn't leave hub until 9:54
