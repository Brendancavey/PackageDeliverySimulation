Packages that were showing on route were not being updated due to the final package delivery time on the last truck iteration
not surpassing packages that were delivered on the previous iteration delivery times, so the loop never got around
to addressing those times. To fix this, I had to create another for-loop going through the entire list of packages, and comparing
the delivery times again to verify if the current time is less than the delivery time. Since we know that truck 3 leaves before
truck2 returns, then we only need to satisfy this condtion on truck 3.

Packages on truck3 on the delivery dictionary were be able to be fixed by keeping track of a global variable
called last package deliverey time. Last package delivered gets updated each time a package with a delivery time
higher than the previous package last package delivery time gets delivered. By returning this variable from the function,
i can keep track of all packages that were supposed to be delivered by a certain time, and that covers the edge cases
for packages showing up incorrectly on the delivery status dictionary.

Program is now funcitoning as intended. All conditions met and satisfied. All thats left is to create cli, and clean up code.
