Found out I can store multiple return values in subsequent variables by returning a tuple of the data I want to return, and
placing the subsequent variables one after another on the function call. 
I dont have to call a function multiple times in order to get different information...-__- dumb mistake. 

Added a look up delivery time function where it returns all packages that were delivered at a specific time
by which driver and by which truck.

Also added changes to package where package can keep track of its delivery driver and delivery truck to reflect changes above.

I added that function to make it easier to see if all time entries in delivery_status up to a certain delivery time should be the same..
since package delivery is updated at the time of a package delivery

Attempted to make the change of package_status for each truck as it enters the function call sequentially, and made
comparisons by time. (i.e if package1 was delivered by truck1 at 9am, then the status of package1 would still be on route if the current time is 8:30am on truck2). It seemed for the most part it was working, but now package_status doesn't seem
to capture delivered items - it's only capturing items that are on route or at the hub. Strange..
