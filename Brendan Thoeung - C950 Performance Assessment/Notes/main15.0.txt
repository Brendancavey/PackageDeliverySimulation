Realized I don't need to add every single minute of the day into the dictionary. I just needed to make a function
where it checks to see if the given time the user wants to check for is in between the previous delivery time, and the
next delivery time. If so, then just return the previous delivery time since the package status remains the
same in between delivery times. 

Then made sure to check for edge cases such as after the last package delivered, and before the first package delivered.

Program is now functioning as expected. All thats left is to satisfy the special project conditions, clean up the code, and create
a user friendly CLI. And if I want to, optimize the solution.
