I said screw it to how I was trying to capture delivery times. Instead, I made a function outside of the delivery,
and compared timestamps to each package. If the timestamp is less than or greater than the compared time stamp, then mark the delivery status.

It seems to be working. Satisfying the conditions need to be met.

met conditions. Omg it works... -_- i could have saved so much time and headache doing it this way.

Program is functioning as expected. With all conditions met. Just need to clean up code.
