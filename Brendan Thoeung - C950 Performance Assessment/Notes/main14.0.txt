After commenting out the for loop that copies all of the times inbetween deliveries as the last previous delivery status,
I managed to find the bug that was causing the delivered packages to not show in the delivery status. After making
that adjustment, the function is working as expected.

However, now I need to find a way to comment back in the function that copies the delivery status of in between deliveries since
thats required for the completion of the project. After commenting back in what I had, more logical errors occurs where
packages status that should be equaling each other are not equaling each other, and package delivery statuses for 
some packages at the end of delivery route are still showing not delivered.
