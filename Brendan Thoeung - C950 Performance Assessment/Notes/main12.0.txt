Found a way to continue using nested dictionaries by incorporating blank dictionaries into each package and update
that exclusive dictionary when that specific package has been delivered. I also capture the delivery time of that package
when its successfully delivered. 

Updated delivery status to reflect this change and instead of capturing a global current time, i capture
the time of when the package was delivered. Currently, this works with only 1 truck. Incorporating multiple trucks
overwrites some data... 

I also incorporated all the minutes and hours of the day into the delivery status dictionary to capture package status
at any given hour and minute. Seconds won't be necessary i think. So when the delivery status updates with the package
being delivered, it just overwrites what is in place of the inititial 24 hour time initiation.

while working on capturing the time and package status of said time, I havent been able to find a way to incorporate
distance mileage travelled. They work separetly from one another, but they cant work together.. Need to find a way for them to work
together.
