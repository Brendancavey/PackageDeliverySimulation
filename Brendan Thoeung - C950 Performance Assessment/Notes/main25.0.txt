Tried all day to implement dijkstra's. No luck converting what I have to work with it. Wasted too much time already. Reverting
back to previous save and continuing from there. 

Implemented more interface and added delivery address as a method of looking up packages.

Issues for delivery status in the delivery_dictionary still present. Refer to notes from main21.0
