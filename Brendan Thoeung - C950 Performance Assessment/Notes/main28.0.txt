Solved the edge case where times before first delivery - 8:06 and after 8am are now showing proper packages on route

Discovered more issues where certain times are show select packages are at hub when they should be on route. Most likely
capturing package status at delivery time are not updating properly. 8:30, 9:30 are times showing wrong information. I'm
sure there are more.

Need to take into consideration delivery times of packages on truck1. Since there are no previous iterations before
truck1, package statuses captured does not reflect future deliveries on on the next iteration. Need to take account
these considerations to simulate real time since truck1 and 2 "leave the hub at the same time".

Fixed the issue above, but seeing the same issues happening for truck 2, where packages delivered from truck 2 don't know
that status of truck3 yet at the time of delivery.
