Solved majority of issues including issues in main21.0
It was caused by capturing the snapshot of the last package delivered. Since last package delivered
was done on truck2, the program hasnt been able to capture the status of items on truck3. By updating
the package status dictionary of the last package delivered one last time after all packages have
been delivered including truck3, It was able to solve the issue.

However found an edge case issue. Inserting times before the first delivery - 8:06 shows all packages still at hub
even when delivery trucks depart at 8:00. Need to show packages were on route between the times of 8:06 and 8:00
